//normal using string like as:

const name="sadanad sharma";
const repocount=50;

//console.log(name+repocount);//using this kinds of formet are old patterns

console.log(`hello my name is ${name} by occupation i am student and my repo count is ${repocount}`);
// The mordern way to using a strings in the form of backtake
// (`- - - - -`${variable name}`- - - - - `)//this is the best method to write a strings in the javascript



//string declared 

const gameName=new String('rohit');
console.log(gameName);
